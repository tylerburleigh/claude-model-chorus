## CLAUDE

SOLID is an acronym for five object-oriented design principles that help create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software:

**S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new functionality without 
changing existing code.

**L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. Derived classes must be
substitutable for their base classes.

**I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. It's better to have many specific interfaces than one 
general-purpose interface.

**D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on 
details; details should depend on abstractions.

These principles, introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), help reduce coupling, increase cohesion, and make code easier to 
understand, test, and maintain. They're particularly relevant in object-oriented programming languages like Java, C#, Python, and 
TypeScript.

## GEMINI

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming, intended to make software designs more 
understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Coined by Robert C. Martin, the acronym stands for:

*   **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single, 
well-defined responsibility.
*   **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. New functionality
should be added without altering existing code.
*   **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without 
affecting the correctness of the program.
*   **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This 
encourages smaller, more specific interfaces.
*   **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on 
abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
