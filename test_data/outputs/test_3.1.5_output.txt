First valid response:
The time complexity of binary search is **O(log n)**, where n is the number of elements in the sorted array.

Here's why:

- Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half
- With each comparison, it eliminates half of the remaining elements
- For an array of size n, you need at most log₂(n) comparisons to find the target (or determine it doesn't exist)

**Space complexity:**
- **O(1)** for iterative implementation (constant extra space)
- **O(log n)** for recursive implementation (due to call stack depth)

**Example:**
- Array of 1,000 elements: max ~10 comparisons (2^10 = 1,024)
- Array of 1,000,000 elements: max ~20 comparisons (2^20 = 1,048,576)

This logarithmic time complexity makes binary search extremely efficient for large sorted datasets, much faster than linear search's O(n) complexity.
