I can help you with testing! What would you like to test? Here are some things I can assist with:

1. **Run existing tests** - Execute test suites and help debug failures
2. **Write new tests** - Create unit tests, integration tests, or other test types
3. **Test specific functionality** - Test a particular feature or component
4. **Review test coverage** - Analyze existing test coverage
5. **Set up testing infrastructure** - Configure testing frameworks or tools

I notice you have several test files in your working directory (test_argument_workflow_*.py, test_chat_workflow_*.py, test_consensus_workflow_*.py). Would you like me to:
- Run these tests?
- Help you understand what they're testing?
- Add more tests?
- Something else?

Please let me know what you'd like to do!
