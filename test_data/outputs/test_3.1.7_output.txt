# Synthesized Response from Multiple Models


## Perspective 1: claude

I'm here to help you with software engineering tasks! You can ask me to:

- Write or modify code
- Debug issues
- Explain code functionality
- Refactor existing code
- Search through your codebase
- Run tests or builds
- Work with git operations
- And much more

I can see you're working in the `claude-model-chorus` project. What would you like me to help you with?

If you need help with Claude Code itself, type `/help`. If you want to give feedback, you can report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues.
