The CAP theorem (also known as Brewer's theorem) is a fundamental principle in distributed systems that states you can only guarantee **two out of three** properties simultaneously:

## The Three Properties

**Consistency (C)**
- All nodes see the same data at the same time
- Every read receives the most recent write or an error
- Think: "Everyone sees the same truth"

**Availability (A)**
- Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write
- The system remains operational even when nodes fail
- Think: "The system always responds"

**Partition Tolerance (P)**
- The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication breakdowns between nodes)
- Think: "Works even when network fails"

## The Trade-off

In distributed systems, **network partitions are inevitable** in real-world scenarios, so P is essentially required. This means you must choose between:

**CP Systems** (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
- Sacrifice availability during partitions
- Better for systems requiring strong consistency
- Examples: HBase, MongoDB (with strong consistency settings), Redis (single-master)

**AP Systems** (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
- Sacrifice consistency during partitions (eventual consistency)
- Better for systems requiring high availability
- Examples: Cassandra, DynamoDB, Couchbase

**CA Systems** (Consistency + Availability)
- Only possible without network partitions
- Traditional relational databases in single-node setups
- Not realistic for distributed systems

## Real-World Impact

Modern systems often use **eventual consistency** models, choosing availability over immediate consistency, and reconciling conflicts later. This is why you might see stale data briefly in systems like DNS, CDNs, or social media platforms.
