Response:
Functional programming emphasizes immutability, first-class functions, and the avoidance of side effects. Key benefits include:

*   **Predictability:** Pure functions, which produce the same output for the same input without side effects, are easier to reason about and test.
*   **Concurrency:** Avoiding shared state and mutable data makes it easier to write concurrent and parallel programs.
*   **Modularity:** Code is often more modular and reusable due to the use of standalone functions.
*   **Readability:** A declarative style can make code more concise and easier to understand.
