Response:

Git merge and git rebase are two different ways to integrate changes from one branch into another:

## Git Merge

- **Creates a new commit** that combines the histories of both branches
- **Preserves the complete history** including all branch commits
- Results in a non-linear history with merge commits
- Safe for public/shared branches
- Easy to understand and undo

Example:
```
# On feature branch
git merge main
```
This creates a merge commit that joins your feature branch with main.

## Git Rebase

- **Rewrites commit history** by moving your commits to a new base
- **Creates a linear history** as if you branched from the latest commit
- Replays your commits one by one on top of the target branch
- **Dangerous for public branches** (rewrites history others may depend on)
- Results in a cleaner, more readable history

Example:
```
# On feature branch
git rebase main
```
This moves your feature commits to start from the latest commit on main.

## When to Use Each

**Use merge when:**
- Working on public/shared branches
- You want to preserve the exact history
- You're merging feature branches into main

**Use rebase when:**
- Cleaning up local commits before pushing
- You want a linear project history
- Updating your feature branch with latest main changes (before merging)

**Golden rule:** Never rebase commits that have been pushed to a shared repository that others might be working from.
