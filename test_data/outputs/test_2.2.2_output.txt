Round 2 result:
REST and GraphQL are both approaches for building APIs, but they differ significantly in how clients request and receive data:

## Key Differences

**Data Fetching**
- **REST**: Multiple endpoints, each returning fixed data structures. You might need multiple requests to gather related data.
  ```http
  GET /api/users/123
  GET /api/users/123/posts
  GET /api/posts/456/comments
  ```
- **GraphQL**: Single endpoint where clients specify exactly what data they need in a query.
  ```graphql
  query {
    user(id: 123) {
      name
      posts {
        title
        comments {
          text
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

**Over/Under-Fetching**
- **REST**: Often returns more data than needed (over-fetching) or requires multiple requests (under-fetching)
- **GraphQL**: Clients request only the fields they need, reducing data transfer

**Versioning**
- **REST**: Often requires versioned endpoints (`/api/v1/users`, `/api/v2/users`)
- **GraphQL**: Schema evolution without versioning - add new fields without breaking existing queries

**HTTP Methods**
- **REST**: Uses different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) semantically
- **GraphQL**: Typically uses POST for all operations (queries and mutations)

**Caching**
- **REST**: Built-in HTTP caching mechanisms work naturally
- **GraphQL**: Caching is more complex, requires additional tooling

**Learning Curve**
- **REST**: Simpler, more straightforward for basic CRUD operations
- **GraphQL**: Steeper learning curve but more powerful for complex data requirements

## When to Use What

**Choose REST when:**
- Simple, well-defined resources
- Heavy use of HTTP caching
- Public APIs with simple data requirements

**Choose GraphQL when:**
- Complex, interconnected data models
- Multiple clients with different data needs
- Rapid frontend iteration
- Need to minimize network requests

Both are valid choices - REST is more established and simpler for straightforward use cases, while GraphQL excels with complex data requirements and flexible client needs.
